<div id="content">
    <p>
        I like theologizing, writing, coding, doing math, watching anime, and a host of other hobbies. Which is what this website is for—providing a specific setting for me to pursue those hobbies and create cool things centered around them.

    <p>
        And besides, it's just helpful to have a place to put helpful information and links.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of links, here's a list of all the notable pages on this website:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/2023/10/01/rtch-500-blog-post">RTCH 500 blog post</a>. An assignment  I turned into a website so I could motivate myself to finish it. Maybe some day I'll go back and redo the CSS.</li>
        <li><a href="/2023/11/25/excursionary-musings-on-baptism">Excursionary musings on baptism</a>. Written while on a 12-hour plane ride. I'll be writing another one of these once I've read more.</li>
        <li><a href="/2024/01/09/polydivisible-numbers-part-1">What's the deal with 381,654,729? Part 1: Transpositions</a>. A multi-part series where I look at the number 381,654,729 and its many peculiarities. Excited to dive into some math for the first time since undergrad!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A secondary goal of this website is to get better at web development. If you see anything in the code that could be improved, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/sleepminusminus">shoot me a DM on Twitter</a>.</p>
