            <h1>Reflections on Ecology and Ministry</h1>

                Growing up, I was never the kind of person to enjoy gardening. I would groan every time my parents would
                haul in a load of mulch from the back of our family minivan, scampering to my room when they called my
                name in a futile attempt to avoid the multiple-hour endeavor of spreading the mulch across the flower
                beds out front. My first trip to the ER involved a particularly unfortunate incident with a shovel
                whilst mulching. My green thumb extends only to the point of picking mint leaves from the plants in our
                backyard for use in my mother's curry.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, I care little for nature. My aesthetic sensibilities are suited for the indoors, away from the
                messiness of the outside world.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I will admit that these sensibilities may be misguided. In particular, upon my study of <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0830852050">Ecologies of Faith in a Digital Age</a></em> by
                Stephen D. Lowe and Mary E. Lowe, I find that much of Scripture and ministry revolves around metaphors
                of natural growth, metaphors which are crucial for my personal growth. In particular, I have learned
                much about spritual growth through their approach to the parables of growth and their emphasis on
                reciprocity in interactions between Christians.
            </p>
            <h1>Ecology in Scripture</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout the pages of the Bible, one common collection of themes echoes over and over: the theme of
                nature and natural growth. It is not to no purpose that the Garden is an image of paradise in the very
                first pages of Scripture: "a pristine, divinely created environment" (Lowe and Lowe, 18) where all of
                God's creation woxrked in harmony, bringing about flourishing for humans and the world as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though we could trace this ecological focus in a number of Scripture passages, the parables of growth
                stand out to me because they trace a clear link between human flourishing and natural processes. Mark
                4:26-29, the parable of the growing seed, likens the kingdom of God to a seed that sprouts apart from
                the growth of the farmer.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Just like a seed that grows in the ground without human interference, the path to flourishing is
                    often out of our control.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as I find that concept encouraging, it also produces some fear in my heart. I worry that my
                efforts to grow in my faith will result in no purpose, because it is often difficult to see the fruit.
                However, I must remember that this lack of ability to see is part of the natural processes by which the
                kingdom functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Perhaps the point of the parable is to remind us to have faith in the processes of growth that God has
                established in nature and the kingdom" (Lowe and Lowe, 44). The ecological theme of Scripture reminds me
                that God brings growth, and as a follower, my job is to open myself up to receive his work.
            </p>
            <h1>Ecology in the Church</h1>
            <p>
                Naturally, the chief means by which God works among his people is through the church, which is his body.
                Here, too, the ecological metaphor is crucial. For an ecosystem works only when each of its interlocking
                parts work reciprocally in order to accomplish the purposes of the ecosystem, and it is the same with
                the church.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our modern, individualistic perspective often glosses over this crucial fact: <b>in the New Testament,
                    spiritual growth is primarily accomplished through reciprocal fellowship in the body</b>.
            </p>

            </a>
            <p>
                For examples, one need look no further than Paul's epistle to the Philippians, where συν-compounds
                (words formed using the Greek adjective συν, glossed as "together with") abound.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indeed, in Philippians 2, one of the central New Testament passages on the church, Paul encourages the
                Philippians believers to be σύμψυχοι: of one mind (v. 2). This one-mindedness is a unity they accomplish
                together through mutual service (v. 3), together following the humble example of their Savior (vv. 6-8)
                so that they too can share in his reign (vv. 9-11), and together working out their salvation (v. 12) in
                the full knowledge that <em>Christ works in their reciprocal love for one another.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Paul's preference was to work collaboratively and flexibly with partners who shared his vision of a
                harmoniously functioning ecology of interconnected and gifted members" (169). In the church, we must not
                content ourselves with a vision of flourishing in which we are passive recipients of sanctification.
                Growth is reciprocal: I grow inasmuch as I use my spiritual gifts to bring forth growth in others.
            </p>
            <h1>Ecology in Practice</h1>
            <p>
                In my reflection on these implications of the ecology of spiritual growth, I'm planning on implementing
                a few practices in order to apply what I've learned in the way I approach life and ministry:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>I resolve to give up measuring my spiritual growth as a function of my spiritual disciplines.</b>
                    Growth is not something I can or should control. Instead, I should leave growth in the Lord's hands,
                    knowing that he is the one who ultimately brings forth fruit. When I am tempted to be discouraged
                    about my failure to practice spiritual disciplines correctly, I will trust that God is working, even
                    as my spiritual life feels dormant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>I resolve to order my priorities so that church involvement takes center stage.</b> Because
                    growth in the body of Christ is reciprocal, I should not expect that I will grow in my faith by simply
                    attending church. Instead, I should become an active participant in the worship and practices of the
                    church, so that the whole body of Christ is built up. I will consider adjusting my shifts at work so
                    that I am able to participate in more church gatherings throughout the week.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Ecology in Seminary Education</h1>
            <p>
                Additionally, to those currently considering seminary education, I offer two pieces of advice based on
                the ecologies of spritual growth found in Scripture and church:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Don't view academic performance as an indicator of spiritual success.</b> Josh Chatraw <a
                            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1587435594">pierces to the heart of the matter</a>: "We 
                    academic types can hide our wounds behind our intellect" (xii). We are so concerned with ensuring that
                    our peers can see our success, so concerned with proving ourselves that we are unable to open ourselves
                    to God's quiet work of natural growth in our lives, apart from our ability to bring it about through
                    study and accomplishment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Your seminary education moves at the speed of relationships.</b> You will not thrive in seminary
                    if you content yourself with simply attending classes, taking notes, submitting assignments, and
                    acquiring good grades. The chief goal of seminary is that you would grow in the knowledge and fear
                    of the Lord: that you would grow spiritually. And you can only grow spiritually if you take initiative
                    to build relationships with other people. Rather pointedly, but not without a degree of accuracy, 
                    H. Daniel Zacharias and Benjamin K. Forrest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1577997786">exhort their seminary-minded readers</a>, "you alone are 
                    responsible for your successes and failures in life" (67). You alone are responsible for whether you
                    build relationships with professors and students in seminary that will form you spiritually into the
                    person who can minister to others, whether vocationally and otherwise.
                </li>
            </ul>
