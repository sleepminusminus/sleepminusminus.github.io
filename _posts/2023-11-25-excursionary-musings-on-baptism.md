title: Excursionary musings on baptism
---

Currently, I'm venturing into the literature surrounding infant baptism to be
able to provide a more robust defense of the practice. Here are my current
questions, and following, my tentative answers.

1. Does infant baptism require, or is it inextricably associated with, baptismal
regeneration? If so, is baptismal regeneration a defeater for infant baptism?
2. What about the spiritual infant baptism view (we baptize those who are
spiritual infants—who have by their faith now been born into the family of God)
Does this view have sufficient explanatory power as to render traditional infant
baptism moot?
3. What about those who are baptized as infants and do not grow into adult
faith? What is the role of baptism in their case?
4. What is the definition of baptism on a traditional infant baptism view, and
how does this differ from the credobaptist view?
5. Why do we not baptize the grandchildren of believers? Why only the children?
6. Why not baptize all infants?
7. What is a positive case for infant baptism in Scripture and the life of the
church?

We can distinguish between five different views on baptism, depending on how
baptism is defined and how it functions in the economy of salvation:

1. declarative baptism: baptism is purely a public declaration of a decision of
salvation, and does not participate in the economy of salvation.
2. credobaptism: baptism symbolizes the conscious, individual faith of the
participants. It does not necessarily participate in the order of salvation.
3. spiritual infant baptism: baptism symbolizes the participant's birth into the
family of God through his conscious, individual faith. It is associated most
closely with regeneration, viewed here as an intrinsic change whereby one dies
to sin and becomes alive in Christ.
4. meritorious infant baptism: baptism symbolizes the participant's birth into
the family of God through the faith of the church of which they are a member, as
well as their own individual faith if applicable. It is associated most closely
with regeneration, viewed here as an intrinsic change whereby one receives the
inward grace necessary to follow Christ.
5. traditional infant baptism: baptism symbolizes the participant's birth into
the family of God through the faith of the church of which they are a member, as
well as their own individual faith if applicable. It is associated most closely
with regeneration, viewed here as a relational change, whereby the self in its
disposition and actions is reoriented towards Christ.

Baptism can be viewed as a gift that the recipients must themselves take up. In
this sense it is not mechanistic or intrinsic, not the flipping of a switch, any
more than the speaking of the words "I pronounce you husband and wife" produces
a metaphysical change in the bride and groom. Instead it's the gifting of a new
identity and a new story, a story where the believer is caught up in union with
Christ, no longer their own but a living member of Christ's body.

The key here is that regeneration, closely linked with baptism, does not refer
to a mechanistic or systematic aspect of the order of salvation but rather is an
image that stands for aspects of the whole of it. It is the whole process of
being-born-again, rather than a single, defined point of that process.

<span class="point"> So to 1. I answer yes.</span> Infant baptism in my view
centers around regeneration, though not in a rigidly causal or metaphysical way.
I see it a lot like marriage—the ceremony is functioning in a real and
substantive way, but not as to supersede the work that is going on as the couple
die to selves and embrace Christ. In the same way regeneration is something
that's going on in baptism, but it's really emblematic of the whole life of the
Christian, who daily dies to sin and lives to righteousness.

Baptismal regeneration is only a defeater for infant baptism if regeneration is
viewed so narrowly as to eviscerate the metaphor utterly. But when we see
baptismal regeneration as an image for our daily walk with Christ—or rather our
daily walk with Christ as an outworking of our baptism!—we will see that it
deeply enlivens the believer's understanding of baptism, and energizes a defense
of infant baptism.

Though I will say that I need to do some reading of the relevant passages to
determine whether regeneration is rightly a systematic category.

<span class="point">As for 2.,</span> the three standard reasons are (a)
tradition (b) continuance of circumcision and (c) family solidarity as seen in
Acts and 1 Corinthians. Each of these is not without significant difficulty,
though—especially (b) since one could easily reject that the continuity is for
physical children. My theory is that one can't hold the spiritual infant view
and still hold to type I baptismal regeneration, but I have no evidence for this
view, and in fact it seems more probable that one could, even if that never
happens in practice.

I think the argument at some level would simply be that Acts 2 frames the new
covenant as something for "you and your children," alluding to the old covenant,
and there are significant issues with taking that to mean spiritual children
since that appears to be nowhere in view. Moreover, on a practical level, if
believing parents are to raise their children within the fear of the Lord—even
possibly without the endorsement of the other parent!—it seems like they are
received into the covenant, especially given that they receive baptism rightly.

<span class="point">This last point leads us into question 3.</span>, which I
would also answer in three ways.

1. The stipulation is always that those who receive baptism rightly are welcomed
into the covenant, not simply those who are immersed. This holds for any view of
baptism.
2. Any of the views 1-3 (and 4 for that matter) has this problem—the
problem of potential failure. What helps as a balm to this is holding type I
regeneration rather than type II, so that you're able to see the effect of
baptism as worked out over a long period of time, rather than as a punctiliar,
mechanistic infusion of grace.
3. The analogy of marriage is so helpful here—this would be akin to
someone saying they don't want to do the marriage ceremony until a few years
into cohabitation so that they can <em>make sure</em> that they won't divorce.
The problem here, of course, is that nothing is certain either way. The value of
a marriage ceremony is not that it somehow makes it certain that someone will
remain married forever but that it symbolizes and seals the marriage as
something real in the minds of the participants, something that the bride and
groom will have to live out and will be held accountable for if they do not.

Could one argue that it is cruel to baptize a child into faith if they have no
choice in the matter and then hold them accountable to live into it? Maybe. But
you'd also have to argue that it's cruel for God to hold people accountable to
believe in him since they had no choice to be born in non-Christian households.
And I'm not necessarily going to make that move. I don't think there is such a
thing as non-resistant non-belief, even if resistance isn't experienced as
resistance.

So I don't think neglecting to baptize infants will actually make
things more charitable for them growing up. In fact I think tossing a
growing person into the cascading torrents of individualistic faith at the age
of 13 is more stifling and cruel. There's a way to do infant baptism that isn't
burdensome, just as there's a way for parents to set expectations on their
children that aren't burdensome or just as there's a way to do marriage that
doesn't feel like a chore.

<span class="point">I think my characterization of the views of baptism above
sufficiently answers questions 4 and 6.</span> We don't baptize all infants
because baptism is only efficacious when received rightly, so it's not as if
indiscriminately baptizing every child would accomplish much of anything. It's
the same as saying that we should baptize all adults—it's not significant unless
the actual work of regeneration with the fruit of faith and repentance is taking
place.

Though I think I'll need to do some refining of my categories once I read more
on baptism. If someone were to ask me what baptism was, I would say it is a
symbol of faith, repentance, and regeneration that increases grace in the
recipient. But that's kind of a crummy and lackluster definition—I should really
just memorize article 27.

<span class="point">About question 5</span>, I would probably say that it's fine
for the grandchild of a believer to be baptized if the parents are unbelieving?
I just think it's sort of a nitpicky objection. But
[Gavin Ortlund raises it](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/why-i-changed-my-mind-about-baptism/),
which leads me to believe that it's probably more important than I'm giving it
credit for.

<span class="point">I think 7. can be answered by a robust appeal to the
creational order of families and specifically of Christian families.</span> I
like what J.I. Packer says in
[his little packet on baptism and regeneration](https://bcp2019.anglicanchurch.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ART-Baptism_and_Regeneration_Dr_Packer.pdf)
—part of what it means to confess that baptism ought to be received rightly is
to confess that children should be brought up with an awareness of the
significance of their baptism. The stories about people getting baptized as kids
and not really feeling the significance of it are probably due to a Type II view
of regeneration which cripples the significance of baptism from the outset. We
can do so much better.
